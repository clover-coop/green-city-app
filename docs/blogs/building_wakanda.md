I came across an article about how the fictional city of Wakanda from Black Panther and The Avengers does not have suburbs. There are no roads or cars. It's high tech but also nestled into the forest with plenty of living green nature integrated into the city. Then I saw an article about Asia's largest rooftop farm on top of a school in Bangkok, a real life first step toward building a city integrated with nature. Further research taught me about biophilic cities and it was inspiring to see real life examples already taking shape.
