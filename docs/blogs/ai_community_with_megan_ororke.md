Megan is a data science and technical product consultant. She's interested in meeting people who work on impactful projects at larger companies, enjoy nerding out about ML or love a good theater show. She spent a summer at NASA in an early stage incubator for climate change solutions and enjoys talking about community, co-housing and outdoor adventures.

Luke: How do you think we can best address climate change and any thoughts on local bottom up vs top down?

Megan: Frankly, people are lazy, changing individual human behavior is a formidable hurdle, and technology driven solutions so often fall short. I'm more bullish on process & policy change which are less sexy but have much more massive impact. Companies like Imperfect Produce which redirects food grocery stores don't buy from farmers for cosmetic reasons, or the satellite companies like Planet Labs. There are some niches where individual actions can work well - my friend's indoor plant company (a distributed local nursery for replanting) is booming amid the pandemic for example. But if we look at the big picture, the drivers at the core of mass mentality shifts tend to be policy driven - like solar power rebates that make the cost workable for the masses.

Luke: Fair points and I agree that changing human behavior can be incredibly hard! How about AI - there have been impressive advancements recently and robotic farming and hydroponics are exciting. But I feel conflicted since machine learning consumes a lot of energy to train plus it takes raw materials to build drones and robots.

Megan: True current machine learning models are energy hungry. But so are lots of other things. Bitcoin mining takes massive energy and I'd argue that has less social good than AI. ..

Luke: How about the limits of AI - how close do you think we are to general intelligence? GPT3 was big this year and is a great step forward. Some critiques I've read talk about one shot learning, saying that a human can see a giraffe once or twice and then can identify them, compared to thousands of images required for computers. Some say we can't just keeping increasing the parameters to make bigger models, we need a fundamental shift to reach the next level.

Megan: It sounds like those people are jealous of what OpenAI has achieved! ..

Luke: Shifting to community, you mentioned earlier that people are lazy, or just busy. I've felt this pain myself multiple times when I've tried to build community and recurring events. I tried creating monthly group hikes to bring people together to explore the outdoors and ended up typically just having my two housemates and only one or two other people until I finally got burned out. More recently I tried organizing work lunches with friends in San Francisco and a similar thing happened. What has been your experience with both making new friends and maintaining existing relationships?

Megan: I've had a similar challenge as you. I'd try to organize park days with friends to help people network. I tend to have multiple different networks so sometimes it can be hard to have an event with multiple friend groups when I'm the only one who knows people in both groups. Before the pandemic I'd have lots of events I'd go to so I got plenty of social time that way and I didn't have to worry much about setting up lots of events as my calendar was pretty full. And ironically it sometimes feels easier to meet with a stranger on Lunchclub than it does to meet with a friend. There's just a different mindset it can be a nightmare to find overlapping free time among multiple friends to meet. But friends won't generally be receptive to signing up for a service to manage their personal time to meet with their friends like Lunchclub does for us.

Luke: More generally speaking, what have been your experiences with community and cohousing and what would you like to see in the future?
