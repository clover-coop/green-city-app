I watched Day 2 of The Week and like the first, I cried. I was moved by the horror of chopping or burning off beaks of baby chicks and also inspired by the hope of what people are already doing with lending libraries and Superblocks. Here were some highlights:
- Loneliness kills more than cigarettes or heart disease
- 50% of Americans say no one knows them well, 35% are chronically lonely
- In Europe 75 million people are so isolated they never see a friend or family member more than once a month
- Major regrets of people about to die:
  - I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, rather than what others expected of me.
  - I wish I hadn't worked so hard, and had spent more time with friends and family.
  - I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings
- The story of "more" and the see saw to move to a story of thriving.
  - "Dig it --> make it --> trash it" to circular economy
- Solutions, hope
  - Regenerative agriculture
  - Barcelona's Superblocks (local community, connection)
  - Lending libraries (tool library, repair cafe)

Many years ago I read about a career choosing exercise of writing down ideas until you got to one that made you cry. The idea was that when we find something that truly touches us deeply, it connects with us in an emotional way and that is a sign it is a calling of ours. I'm crying now as I write this. Last night during the discussion after the episode I shared how I've known many of these facts for years and I've made attempts to work on this issue before, but I always gave up. I shared with our group Lora, Mona and Wes how much I cared about leading by example and being the change you wanted to see in the world. My "happy" playlist has The Man in the Mirror and at an Earthshot retreat I cried sharing about reading "Do the Right Thing, Because it is the Right Thing to Do". It's so simple, but so powerful. Last year during a "Forest Council" chat, Bernat shared the inspiring vision of an organization: "imagine if it was undeniable, to everyone, that we were in it for the mission, not the money." Earlier Isak shared how to combat ego, "at every moment, choose others over yourself." Last week Bernat shared the story of scuttling the boats. It's time now to do that. To have the courage to do the right thing. And to trust that we will find a way to sustain ourselves and our families, as we walk away from the story of "more" and to the side of hope and change for this planet. As Frederic Laloux shares in The Week, climate action is the defining crisis of our time, and it starts with individuals having the courage to walk to the other side. Armando has called for declaring a climate emergency. The time is now.

My vision is sustainability for all - both for people to meet their basic needs and feed their families, and for us humans to live sustainably with nature (starting with carbon neutral but more importantly, for all species to thrive). In our current "story of MORE" money drives much of the world and for people to work on this climate crisis they need money to meet basic needs. As we move to our new story of thriving I hope we can simultaneously reduce dependence on money as we live sustainability with the land and shift our personal focus away from money and possessions and toward relationships and experiences, so our individual required income goes down. We're starting with a small team but the new story is a shift from the individual "I" to the global "we" so the intention is to expand so anyone can have the opportunity to thrive; working at the intersection of their passion and our shared mission to help the Earth thrive.

Borrowing from the gift economy which I first learned about through Frederic's Reinventing Organizations, the idea is that people would offer their skills (focused around connection - combatting loneliness and climate change) with a suggested donation and hopefully over time could generate enough income to meet their basic needs. At the same time, we can all work to reduce our monetary needs as we shift from the story of more to one of sustainability. This will require a large enough network to be sustainable, so to start, we'll use a crowdfunding donation system such as GoFundMe to raise an initial amount to fund a small team for a year as we build it out. As an example, for me personally:
- Story of More: $180k+ salary market rate as a software engineer with 15+ years experience.
- Story of Thriving: $105k to $125k for our household (Luke + Lora), so $50k to $65k each. The game changing factor here is house down payment, but I'd love to live in a sustainable community or Superblock / 15 minute city and would be happy to rent and / or I hope we can have much more affordable housing in our future new story so people don't need such large salaries. As it is, rent is by far the biggest expense, followed by health care. As we start a family expenses will go up a bit (maybe $10k annually) for children.

So if we can raise $500k to $1 million we could support 5 to 10 people for a year to seed this project and hopefully get to a sustainable space where we can do consulting / gifting economy work and expand to bring more people into this new story where they can sustainably support themselves while dedicating much of their time to address our climate and loneliness crises. I have some savings so my commitment is to dedicate myself full time, all in, to this for at least 3 to 6 months. Hopefully by then we can raise enough money / bring in enough consulting income to reach $500k+ and work toward a sustainable $40k+ per month to support at least 5 people and then grow that from there. Our suggested donations and the transition from the old story to the new story for our starting team are here.
